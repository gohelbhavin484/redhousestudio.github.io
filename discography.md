I want to create sound image where all music and performance is according to the artist inspiration and therefore can expose this to a bigger listening audience.When all decision in sound creation are according to that one idea.you can create the best experience.And that's makes my heart tick.

I can help compose/arrange/perform your music, record it, mix it.Help you perform your songs, coach and guide you to get the best result.

All these project listed here are different and thus changed my role. But I am always focussed on giving the listener what the artist want to give them.
