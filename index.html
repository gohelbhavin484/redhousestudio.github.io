    RedHouse is a 'perfomance studio'. An intimate studio where musical ideas can be captured without interrupting the flow of a musician. One room where everybody is togather working on the same thing. Mixing or recording, composing or jammin'. Lotsa instrument and amps available to play.<br />
    And yes, I have Phase-Liner-Monitoring, and yes a fancy Millennia pre-amp too, and I could go on dropping names. But that is not the essence of a studio in my view.<br />

  <p>
    Today 1 computer can do all the recording, editng, programming, you just need a place that sounds good and where you feel comfortable.... and a guy that knows how to work that sh*t...)<br />
